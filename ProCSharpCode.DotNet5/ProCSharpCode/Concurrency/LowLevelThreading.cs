    //  Doing more than one thing at a time.

    // Multithreading
    // ---------------
    //  A form of concurrency that uses multiple threads of execution.

    // Parallel processing
    // ---------------
    //  Doing lots of work by dividing it up among multiple threads that run concurrently.

    // Parallel processing(or parallel programming) uses multithreading to maximize the use
    // of multiple processor cores.Modern CPUs have multiple cores, and if there’s a lot of
    // work to do, then it makes no sense to make one core do all the work while the others
    // sit idle. Parallel processing splits the work among multiple threads, which can each
    // run independently on a different core.

    //Parallel processing is one type of multithreading, and multithreading is one type of
    //concurrency.


    // Asynchronous programming
    // ---------------
    //  A form of concurrency that uses futures or callbacks to avoid unnecessary threads.

    // Reactive programming
    // -------------------
    // A declarative style of programming where the application reacts to events.

    //Reactive programming is closely related to asynchronous programming but is built
    //on asynchronous events instead of asynchronous operations.

    #region Introduction
    // ------------------------ Introduction -------------------------
    // Most applications need to deal with more than one thing happening at a time(concurrency).
    // The most common concurrency scenarios are:
    // 
    // Writing a responsive user interface
    // In WPF, mobile, and Windows Forms applications, you must run timeconsuming tasks concurrently with the code that runs your user interface to
    // maintain responsiveness.
    // 
    // Allowing requests to process simultaneously
    // On a server, client requests can arrive concurrently and so must be handled in
    // parallel to maintain scalability. If you use ASP.NET, WCF, or Web Services,
    // the.NET Framework does this for you automatically. However, you still need
    // to be aware of shared state (for instance, the effect of using static variables for
    // caching).
    // 
    // Parallel programming
    // Code that performs intensive calculations can execute faster on multicore/
    // multiprocessor computers if the workload is divided between cores(Chapter 23 is dedicated to this).
    //
    // Speculative execution
    // On multicore machines, you can sometimes improve performance by predict‐
    // ing something that might need to be done, and then doing it ahead of time.

    // ------------------------ I/O-bound versus compute-bound -------------------------
    // I/O-Bound:
    // An operation that spends most of its time waiting for something to happen is called
    // I/O-bound—an example is downloading a web page or calling Console.ReadLine.
    //

    // an operation that spends most of its time performing CPU-intensive work is called computebound.

    #region I/O-bound operations - synchronously And asynchronously waits
    // ------------------------ I/O-bound operations - synchronously And asynchronously waits -------------------------
    //An I/O-bound operation works in one of two ways: 
    //
    // - it either waits synchronously on the current thread until the operation 
    //      is complete(such as Console.ReadLine,Thread.Sleep, or Thread.Join)
    //
    // - or operates asynchronously, firing a callback when
    //      the operation finishes some time later.
    // 
    // -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #endregion

    #region Blocking versus spinning
    // ------------------------ Blocking versus spinning -------------------------
    // I/O-bound operations that wait synchronously spend most of their time blocking a
    // thread.They may also “spin” in a loop periodically:
    // 
    //      while (DateTime.Now<nextStartTime)
    //      Thread.Sleep (100);
    // 
    // Leaving aside that there are better ways to do this (such as timers or signaling con‐
    // structs), another option is that a thread may spin continuously:
    // 
    //      while (DateTime.Now < nextStartTime);
    // 
    // In general, Spin is very wasteful on processor time
    // In effect, we’ve turned what should be an I/Obound operation into a compute-bound operation.
    // 
    // - spinning can be effective when you expect a condition to be satisfied soon
    //   (perhaps within a few microseconds), because it avoids the overhead and 
    //   latency of a context switch.
    //   The .NET Framework provides special methods and classes to 
    //   assist—see “SpinLock and SpinWait”
    // 
    // - Second, blocking does not incur a zero cost. This is because
    //   each thread ties up around 1 MB of memory for as long as it
    //   lives and causes an ongoing administrative overhead for the
    //   CLR and operating system.For this reason, blocking can be
    //   troublesome in the context of heavily I/O-bound programs
    //   that need to handle hundreds or thousands of concurrent
    //   operations.

    // • Blocking pooled threads can degrade performance.

    // - You are free to change the priority of a pooled thread—it will 
    //   be restored to normal when released back to the pool

    // Thread.CurrentThread.IsThreadPoolThread.

    #region Hygiene in the thread pool
    // ------------------------ Hygiene in the thread pool -------------------------
    // The thread pool serves another function, which is to ensure that a temporary excess
    // of compute-bound work does not cause CPU oversubscription.
    
    // Oversubscription 
    // -------------------
    // it is the condition of there being more active threads than CPU cores, with the operating
    // system having to time-slice threads.Oversubscription hurts performance because
    // time-slicing requires expensive context switches and can invalidate the CPU caches
    // that have become essential in delivering performance to modern processors.
    // 
    // The CLR avoids oversubscription in the thread pool by queuing tasks and throttling
    // their startup. It begins by running as many concurrent tasks as there are hardware
    // cores, and then tunes the level of concurrency via a hill-climbing algorithm, continually 
    // adjusting the workload in a particular direction.If throughput improves, it
    // continues in the same direction (otherwise it reverses). This ensures that it always
    // tracks the optimal performance curve—even in the face of competing process activity 
    // on the computer.
    // 
    // The CLR’s strategy works best if two conditions are met:
    // • Work items are mostly short-running(<250ms, or ideally <100ms), so that the
    //   CLR has plenty of opportunities to measure and adjust.
    // • Jobs that spend most of their time blocked do not dominate the pool.
    // 
    // - For longer-running and blocked Operation, you should avoid use of a pooled thread.

    // Blocking is troublesome because it gives the CLR the false idea that it’s loading up
    // the CPU.The CLR is smart enough to detect and compensate(by injecting more
    // threads into the pool), although this can make the pool vulnerable to subsequent
    // oversubscription. It also may introduce latency, as the CLR throttles the rate at
    // which it injects new threads, particularly early in an application’s life(more so on
    // client operating systems where it favors lower resource consumption).
    // Maintaining good hygiene in the thread pool is particularly relevant when you want
    // to fully utilize the CPU

    // - Cache Invalidation at Context Switching when there are CPU Oversubscriptions
